I’m @Epanemu, a European PhD student.

I enjoy Artificial Intelligence from every feasible angle.
Working on XAI and fairness methods, utilizing Mixed-Integer Optimization.

Paper repos I work(ed) on:
 - [LiCE](https://github.com/epanemu/LiCE) - Likely Counterfactual Explanations ([paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rGyi8NNqB0) at ICLR 2025)
 - [MSD](https://github.com/epanemu/MSD) - Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy - AI Bias detection method (at KDD 2025)
   - [HumanCompatible.Detect](https://github.com/humancompatible/detect) - Contains the MSD implementation to use in your projects. 

Some part of my work not presented here can be found on my [GitLab](gitlab.com/epanemu).
